### Notes

This is my last year as a master student, I am busy writing my thesis and preparing for my graduation. I'll try my best to clean the codes and upload the pre-trained models as soon as possible.

Furthermore, we hope our work can inspire others when doing 3D-aware representation learning. Lifting and adv training is feasible for human-centric tasks, but how to do the 3D-aware representation learning for other tasks (e.g., Object Dection) is worth further research!
