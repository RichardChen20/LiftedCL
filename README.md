## <b>Project Webpage</b>

This template was originally made by Phillip Isola and Richard Zhang for a [colorful ECCV paper](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/).

To use this template, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/richzhang/webpage-template.git
```

Copy the contents into a `gh-pages` branch of a GitHub repo. That will automatically make a webpage under address [GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME](GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME).
